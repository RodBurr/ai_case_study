# Grammarly - AI Driven Writing Assistance Tool.
## Overview

Grammarly is a writing assistant tool founded in 2009 by Max Lytvyn, Alex Shevchenko, and Dmytro Lider. It was a writing assistance tool that focused on grammar and spelling for students. They expanded on that idea to incorporate AI and ML,  _"to analyze complex aspects of language and generate ideas and drafts, making it an all-in-one writing partner for professional writing" (About Grammarly)_.

Grammarly is a subscription-based product funded by 8 investors, _"Baillie Gifford and BlackRock are the most recent investors" (Grammarly: Company Financials)_. They have raised $400M in funding over 3 rounds, with the last raised on Nov 17, 2021. They are valued at over $10B. 



## Business Activities

The world is quickly moving closer to fully digital by the day. This makes effective written communication more critical for success than ever before. Many people struggle with grammar, spelling, and tone, which can lead to misunderstandings and reduce the overall effectiveness of their communication. Traditional proofreading tools were not adaptive enough to meet modern needs. Grammarly seeks to fill this gap by offering a wide array of tools across nearly all forms of digital communication. Grammarly is designed to improve writing while preserving the user's individual voice. To achieve this, they use a _"variety of AI technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to improve writing"(found using Google Gemini via Google Search)_: 
* Features
    * **Style and Clarity:** Offers suggestions to improve clarity, text engagement, and maintaining a consistent tone.
    * **Plagirism Dectection:**  Detection tool checks from a massive database of online publications, websites, and academic papers. Useful to help students and professional writers avoid plagiarism and to help identify plagiarism. 
    *  **Personalize Feedback:** Grammarly learns the user's writing style and tendencies and offers more specialized suggestions.
    *  **Readiability Score:** Offers a numerical representation 0-100, signifying how easy the user's writing is to understand.
    *  **Grammar and Spelling Checks**
      
Grammarly is available for Google Docs, Grammarly Desktop and mobile app, Microsoft Word, and Browser extension. Their nearest competitors only offer their services across Google Docs, a Browser Extention, and Microsoft Word. Grammarly is also the only one among their piers that offers a tone checker and readability score. Additionally, you can hire professional editors via Grammarly, for those who want a more human touch.

## Landscape

Grammarly is one of the leaders in the NLP field. In recent years the NLP landscape has seen growing interest in Virtual Assistants,

     They mitigate processing errors and work continuously, unlike human virtual assistants. Additionally, NLP-powered virtual assistants find applications in providing information to factory workers, assisting academic research, and more.

There have also been trends toward Multilingual Langauge Models. Most current language processors focus on English and do not cater to other markets. Expanding the dataset in different languages allows NLP models to accurately understand data in different languages. Text Summarization is an emerging trend as well. NLPs are very good at analyzing large datasets to understand human language. However, they typically cannot siphon useful information when analyzing large documents. Startups are using ML, _"to develop NLP models that summarize lengthy texts into a cohesive and fluent summary that contains all key points", ("Natural Language Processing Trends – 5 Trends Shaping the Industry in 2024.")._

While Grammarly is more specialized in its approach to NLP, there are other companies investing resources in this field. Namely Google Cloud, OpenAi, Apple, IBM, Intel, and Amazon Web Services. In its specific niche in the market, it stands at the forefront of other companies such as ProWritingAId, White Smoke, Ginger, Hemingway Editor, and Virtual Writing Tutor.

## Results

Grammarly is the leader in AI-Driven Writing Assistance Tools. It has set the bar and pushed NLP forward to improve users' personal writing. Its success can be seen through its 6.9M daily users and  $279M in yearly revenue, not to mention its $13B market value. These lead its competitors in this niche branch of NLP by a noticeable margin. 


## Recommendations

To improve on its product I would recommend that that expand the amount of languages Grammarly supports. Currently, it only supports English, while a few of its competitors can translate into multiple languages. This would greatly expand their reach beyond native English speakers, as well as offer an additional selling point. They are the only product of its kind with a mobile app, so allowing written translations on your phone via the app will bring another level of convenience, while also allowing for further assistance via conveying proper tone. There are already emerging technologies that could assist in this process. As mentioned earlier, several start-ups are working with Multilingual Langauge Models.
