## Business Activities

The world is quickly moving closer to fully digital by the day. As such effective written communication is more critical for success that ever before. Many people struggle with grammar, spelling, and tone, which can lead to misunderstandings and reduce the overall effectiveness of their communication. Traditional proofreading tools were not adaptive enough to meet modern needs. Grammarly seeks to fills this gap, by offering a wide array of tools to use across nearly all forms of digital communication. Grammarly is designed to improve writing while preserving the user's indiviual voice. To acheive this they use a _"variety of AI technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to improve writing",(found using Google Gemini via Google Search)_: 
* Features
    * **Style and Clarity:** Offers suggestion to improve clarity, aswell as text engagment, and maintaining a consistant tone.
    * **Plagirism Dectection:**  Dectection tool checks from a massive database of online publications, website, and academis papers. Useful to help students and professional writers avoid plagirism, and to help identify plagirism.

Grammarly is also the only one among their piers that offer a tone checker and readiablity score. Grammarly also offers the ability to hire proffesinal editors, for those who want a more human touch.

## Landscape

Grammarly is one of the major leaders in the AI, speficially NLP field, aswell as Data Science. I recent years within the NLP landscape there has seen growing interest in, Virtual Assistants,

     They mitigate processing errors and work continuously, unlike human virtual assistants. Additionally, NLP-powered virtual assistants find applications in providing information to factory workers, assisting academic research, and more.

There have also been trends towards Multilingual Langauge Models. Most current langauge processors focus on English, and do not cater to other markets, expanding the dataset in different langauges allows NLP models to accurately understand data in different langauges. Text Summarization is a emerging trend as well. NLPs are very good at analyzing large datasets to understand human langauge, but typically lack the ability to siphon useful information when analyzing large documents. Startups are using ML, "to develop NLP models that summarize lengthy texts into a cohesive and fluent summary that contains all key points", ("Natural Language Processing Trends – 5 Trends Shaping the Industry in 2024.").

While Grammarly is more specialized in it's approach to NLP, there are several other large companies investing resources into this field, namely Google Cloud, OpenAi, Apple, IBM, Intel, and Amazon Web Services. However, if we talk about it's specific niche space in the market, it stand in the forefront of other companies such as ProWritingAId, White Smoke, Ginger, Hemingway Editor, and Virtual Writing Tutor.

## Results

Grammarly is the leader in AI Driven Writing Assistance Tools. It has set the bar and pushed NLP forward specifically in helping to improve users personal writing. It's success can be seen through the it's 6.9M daily users and it's $279M in yearly revunuem, not to mention it $13B market value. These lead it's competitors in this niche branch of NLP by a noticable margin. 


## Recommendations

To improve on it's product I would recommend that that expand the amount of langauges Grammarly supports. Currently it only supports English, while some of it's competitors offer the ability to translate into multiple langauges. This would greatly expand their reach beyond native english speakers, as well offer an additonal selling point. They are the only product of it's kind with a mobile app, so allowing writen translations on your phone via the app will bring another level of convience, while also allowing for further assistance via conveying proper tone. There are already emerging technologies that could assisit in this process. As mentioned earlier, there are several start ups working with Multilingual Langauge Models.
